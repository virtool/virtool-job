    Build a Workflow using the functions in a module which have been marked using a `workflow_marker`.

    Since Python 3.7 dictionaries maintain insertion order. A side effect of this is that a module's
    __dict__ attribute maintains **definition** order, since attributes are added to the dict as they
    are defined.

    The same is true in Python 3.6, however it is an implementation detail. This function may not work
    as intended in versions of python previous to 3.6 as it assumes that a module's __dict__ attribute is
    in definition order.

    :param module: A module containing functions tagged by the `workflow_marker` decorators.
    :return Workflow: A workflow build using the tagged functions.
